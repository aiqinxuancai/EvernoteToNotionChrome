# EvernoteToNotionChrome

A tool for migrating from Evernote to Notion, its main function is to **store images in Notion**, rather than just URL references.

Currently, there are two modes available for selection. The first is to convert to a Docx file, and the second is to replace the image URLs in the HTML file with Base64. Both methods can achieve storing images in Notion.

Just enter the folder containing your exported HTML from Evernote in the input box, then select the mode and click start.
