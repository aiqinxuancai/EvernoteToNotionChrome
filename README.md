**EvernoteToNotionChrome has been released for a long time.** Recently, Notion made changes to the way images are referenced. Now, images must be accompanied by a signature and verified with cookies for login status. This means that the previous method can no longer be used.

**However, a new method has emerged, which is to convert HTML to Word files.** The Word file will contain all the image information in a single file, making it easy to upload.

## Quick start

1. Download the Release and extract it, then run HTMLToDocX.exe.
2. Export the notebook from Evernote as HTML multiple files.
3. Fill in the directory where the exported HTML files are located in HTMLToDocX and click on start.
4. Import the docx files to Notion.
