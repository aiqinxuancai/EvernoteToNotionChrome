**EvernoteToNotionChrome has been released for a long time.** Recently, Notion made changes to the way images are referenced. Now, images must be accompanied by a signature and verified with cookies for login status. This means that the previous method can no longer be used.

**However, a new method has emerged, which is to convert HTML to Word files.** The Word file will contain all the image information in a single file, making it easy to upload.

## Quick start

1.下载Release并解压缩，运行HTMLToDocX.exe
2.导出Evernote
