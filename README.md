# EvernoteToNotionChrome

I tried to transfer Evernote to Notion, but all the methods mentioned online failed. So, I wrote this program to upload the images exported from Evernote's HTML to Notion and modify the exported HTML file. The modified HTML file can directly import into Notion and display the images correctly (the images are stored in Notion).

[Quick start(Chinese中文)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/403978229)

## Quick start

1. Download the program in Release and run EvernoteToNotionChrome.exe, log in your Notion account in the Chromium engine embedded in the program

2. Create a new Page as the "image bed" for uploading images

3. Export the notes from Evernote using separate HTML  

4. Paste the path of the exported notes into EvernoteToNotionChrome

5. Click Start, the image will be uploaded (the upload process will occupy the system clipboard)
