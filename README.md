# HTMLToNotion

本项目解决使用HTML导入Notion时，HTML中的图片是URL引用而非存储到Notion的问题。

亦可解决Evernote导出的多个HTML导入时无图片或者也是URL引用的问题。

**使用本工具转换后的HTML文件导入Notion时，图片均存储在Notion中。**

A tool for migrating from Evernote to Notion, its main function is to **store images in Notion**, rather than just URL references.

Currently, there are two modes available for selection. The first is to convert to a Docx file, and the second is to replace the image URLs in the HTML file with Base64. Both methods can achieve storing images in Notion.

Just enter the folder containing your exported HTML from Evernote in the input box, then select the mode and click start.
