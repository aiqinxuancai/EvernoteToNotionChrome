# EvernoteToNotionChrome

I tried to transfer evernote to notion, but all the methods described online failed, so I wrote this program to upload the HTML images exported by evernote to notion and modify the exported HTML file, the modified HTML can be directly imported into notion to display the images normally (the images are stored in notion)
